      <p>Off Street Carpentry born from over twenty five years of witnessing continuous
      waste amongst the building trades. Often times on job sites, shorter pieces of wood
      will be disposed of. They clutter up the work area and are generally moved around so
      much that they become a nuisance. It's just simply easier to throw them in the
      dumpster.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
      Knowing that there could be a better, creative way
      to make use of this waste, a true visionary set out to
      find different ways to rescue these forlorn timbers.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
      In the vein of good old fashioned American spirit, the first product off the line was
      Ol' Glory herself. The stars and stripes began the journey and open the door for many creations
      to come.</p>
